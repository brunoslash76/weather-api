# Weather App

This is part of my begginers course for developping web apps with API's integrations.

This is fase one of my 5 modules course. This is to show how we can start a simple web app using just HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In this first part I intent to show how bigger one simple app can be with one JS file and how simple can it be.

This project connects with Open Weather Map which is a forecast data provider. We use API integrations with `fetch` API.

Updates in the future as I follow to build this course.

## How to install 

Clone this repository, if you are using VSCode you can install Live Server extension and start it and eveything will be setup to run. 

This project is focuse on mobile screen size so you might want to resize your browser to have a better experience.

If you dont use VSCode you can add this to a MAMP or XAMP htdos folder and run the server and access the right URL to view the application.
